                <p>
                    Born and raised in Strömstad, a city located in the northern parts of Bohuslän, situated close to the Norwegian border.
                    Once a city marked as the place to travel to on the summers, it's now just a gigantic shopping mall for norwegians.
                    Managed to escape eight years ago and moved with my wife and two out of my three kids to Ängelholm.
                    Worked as an Operating Manager at a major retail chain for seven years, before making a tough life choice and changed path to walk down.
                    Studied to become an Java Developer and graduated spring of 2021, but was'nt satisfied with myself and decided to continue the path of learning.
                    Hence, I am now studying to become an Frontend Developer and perhaps end up a Fullstack Developer in the future.

                    Best quote comes from late George Carlin, Comedian, and by looking at call-out culture of today, those words has never been more true:
